# Gold (XAUUSD) M5 Trading Bot

A trend-pullback trading bot for XAUUSD on the 5-minute chart, built around
MetaTrader 5, with a bar-by-bar backtester that shares its risk-management
code with the live trader so simulated and real behaviour never drift apart.

## Disclaimer

No trading strategy is guaranteed to be profitable. Gold on M5 is noisy and
spread/slippage costs are real. Backtest results here use synthetic data for
smoke-testing the engine only — **you must backtest on real historical
XAUUSD M5 data and forward-test on a demo account before ever risking real
money.** Past backtest performance never guarantees future results.

## Strategy

See the docstring in `gold_bot/strategy.py` for full rationale. Summary:

1. **Trend filter (two timeframes)** — price must be above/below a slow EMA
   on M5 *and* the higher timeframe (default M15) must agree, to filter out
   most chop.
2. **Pullback trigger** — RSI must have recently dipped toward oversold
   (uptrend) or overbought (downtrend), then cross back through a mid-level,
   i.e. trade the resumption of the trend after a shallow pullback rather
   than blindly trading every EMA cross.
3. **Momentum confirmation** — MACD histogram must be turning back in the
   trend direction on the signal bar.
4. **Session filter** — entries only fire during London / New York session
   windows (configurable, UTC), since gold's real momentum is concentrated
   there; outside these windows M5 moves are mostly spread/noise.

Exits: ATR-based stop loss and take profit, with an optional ATR chandelier
trailing stop. All of these multipliers, EMA/RSI periods, and session times
are configurable in `config/config.yaml`.

## Risk management

`gold_bot/risk_manager.py` centralizes every risk rule so backtest and live
trading use identical logic:

- Position size computed so a stop-out risks exactly `risk_per_trade_pct` of
  current equity (not a fixed lot size).
- `max_trades_per_day` and `max_concurrent_trades` caps.
- `max_daily_loss_pct` circuit breaker — once tripped, no new trades open
  until the next calendar day (UTC).
- Optional ATR-based trailing stop that only ever moves in the trade's
  favor.

## Setup

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

`MetaTrader5` only installs/works on Windows (it talks to a local MT5
terminal process). On Linux/macOS you can still develop the strategy and run
backtests — just skip live trading.

## Backtesting

Provide a CSV with columns `time,open,high,low,close` (time parseable as
UTC), for example real XAUUSD M5 history exported from your broker/MT5:

```bash
python scripts/run_backtest.py --data data/XAUUSD_M5_demo_sample.csv --config config/config.yaml
python scripts/run_backtest.py --data data/your_real_data.csv --plot equity.png
```

Output includes trade count, win rate, profit factor, total return, and max
drawdown.

### Real backtest results (honest numbers, read before trusting this bot)

`data/XAUUSD_M5_real.csv` is 5 years of real XAUUSD M5 data (2020-08-21 to
2025-08-01, 350,903 bars), pulled from the public dataset in
[ilahuerta-IA/backtrader-pullback-window-xauusd](https://github.com/ilahuerta-IA/backtrader-pullback-window-xauusd).

Parameters were tuned with `scripts/optimize.py` using a train/test split
(train: 2020-08 to 2023-08, test: 2023-08 to 2025-08) to reduce overfitting.
**Important caveat:** every single parameter combination tested lost money
on the train split. The reason: the train period was essentially flat for
gold (+0.4% net over 3 years, choppy), while the test period was a strong
uptrend (+71.2%). A trend-pullback strategy structurally needs a trend to
profit from — no amount of parameter tuning fixes that, it can only reduce
how much a choppy period costs you.

Current `config/config.yaml` defaults (`ema_slow=100`, `rsi_pullback_level=50`,
`atr_sl_mult=2.0`, `atr_tp_mult=3.0` — wider ATR stop than the original guess,
which mattered more than any other single change) give, over the full 5
years:

| Metric | Value |
|---|---|
| Trades | 264 (~53/year) |
| Win rate | 44.7% |
| Profit factor | 1.20 |
| Total return | +16.91% / 5 years |
| Max drawdown | -13.27% |

That is a real edge, but a modest one (~3%/year before broker commissions),
concentrated almost entirely in the 2024-2025 trending period — 2020-2023
was flat-to-losing. **Do not expect this to profit in a sideways/choppy
gold market.** Re-run `scripts/optimize.py` periodically as new data comes
in, and never skip the demo-account forward-test step before going live.

## Live / paper trading (Windows + MT5 required)

1. Install and log into the MT5 terminal for your broker.
2. Set credentials via environment variables (preferred over editing
   `config.yaml` directly):

   ```bash
   set MT5_LOGIN=12345678
   set MT5_PASSWORD=your-password
   set MT5_SERVER=YourBroker-Demo
   ```

3. Run:

   ```bash
   python scripts/run_live.py --config config/config.yaml
   ```

Start on a **demo account** first. The loop polls every `--poll-seconds`
(default 15s), evaluates the strategy once per newly closed M5 bar, trails
stops on open positions, and opens new trades only when the risk manager
allows it.

## Tests

```bash
pytest tests/ -v
```

## Tuning

All strategy/risk/session parameters live in `config/config.yaml` — no code
changes needed to experiment with EMA periods, RSI levels, ATR multipliers,
risk per trade, or session windows. Re-run the backtest after every change
on real historical data before touching a live/demo account.
